# bingo
Bingo is a POC for auto-suggestion guessing attack. This attack enables a man in the middle to guess a search query made by the user, based upon the packet sizes returned by the auto-suggestion mechanism.
Even the project name is Bingo, the POC is targeted for duckduckgo.

The project was built during BIU cyber acathon - Breaking The Anonymity.
